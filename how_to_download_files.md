There are two ways to download the notebooks with the exercises to your computer. You can use the Github functionalities, if you know how to do this. If you don't, don't worry. Just press the green "Code" buttom above, and then press "Download ZIP".

Another method to work with the notebooks is to open them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) using (this link)[https://colab.research.google.com/github/AsgerAndersen/basecamp_stats_intro/blob/master/]. However, this demands that you have a google account. Also, you cannot save any changes you make to a notebook, which you have opened in Colab, unless you make sure to save a copy of it on your google drive.
